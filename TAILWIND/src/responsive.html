<!-- Read the docs for responsive on tailwind, basically the framework is default for smaller/ mobile screens, so sm doe  not mean smaller screens but it means smaller breakdown like fr ex if 640px is the breakdonw point, then sm will mean that its after the brakdown like for above 640px sm will be used so its more likely to be said that sm is small screen breakdown point, like 640px is sm breakdown point, then using sm for large screen is correct and notmal text on small screens, the main thing is this framworks are for smaller screen first then we make it responsive for larger screens, if not understood just watch the hitesh video -->
